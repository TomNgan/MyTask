# MyTask
A Simple Todo App

## Description
As a programmer, I want to create a to-do application for myself. To find best practices, I took a course called "iOS 12 and Swift 5: Building a To-Do List Application". Although the course is not updated to iOS 13, the instructor has a good explanation of the concept of swift. Finally, I changed some codes to fit the iOS 13.
